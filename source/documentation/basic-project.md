A Sculpin project is capable of building exactly one static site. By default,
Sculpin is configured to work with the following file structure:

    |-- app/
    |  |-- SculpinKernel.php           # Custom Sculpin kernel
    |  `-- config/
    |     |-- sculpin_kernel.yml       # Sculpin's configuration
    |     |-- sculpin_site.yml         # Site meta data
    |     `-- sculpin_site_${env}.yml  # Env specific meta data
    |-- output_${env}/                 # Env specific generated files
    |-- source/                        # Files in here are read and compiled
    |  |-- _posts/                     # Individual blog posts live here
    |  `-- _views/                     # Templates
    `-- composer.json                  # Dependencies

Sculpin reads all files that are under the source directory. Sculpin
expects this directory to be called `source/` in your project root. For
example, if you have a file called `source/index.md`, Sculpin will
generate a file called `output_dev/index.html`.

Besides the actual content, the `index.md` can also provide metadata.
See [Sources]({{site.url}}/documentation/sources/) for the details.

Once created, the `output_prod` folder can be uploaded to a web server
as-is. Because Sculpin is a static site generator, no PHP is used on the
server. This provides greater freedom in hosting choices.

## Commands

### Rendering your Site

The `generate` command looks for files in your source directory and
generates static HTML files:

    vendor/bin/sculpin generate

Your generated web site would then be available in `output_dev`.

The `generate` command has two useful options for editing your site
locally:

* `--watch` will monitor the source directory and regenerate the site
  whenever a source file is changed
* `--server` serves files over HTTP with the built-in webserver

Combining these flags will let you edit your site locally and view the
changes by refreshing your browser.

```
vendor/bin/sculpin generate --watch --server
```

This launches your site in `dev` mode at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

The `generate` command also has a `--port` option, in case you need the web
server to run on a different port:

    vendor/bin/sculpin generate --watch --server --port=8888

Besides using the `--server` option for `generate`, there are some other
options for previewing the rendered pages locally.

#### Serve Command

To serve files that have already been generated, use the `serve`
command:

    vendor/bin/sculpin serve

This mode will not automatically detect and update changes.

#### Using a Standard Webserver

The only special consideration that needs to be taken into account for standard
webservers **in development** is the fact that the URLs generated may not match
the path at which the site is installed.

This can be solved by overriding the `site.url` configuration option when
generating the site.

    vendor/bin/sculpin generate --url=http://my.dev.host/blog-skeleton/output_dev

With this option passed, `{{ site.url }}/about` will now be generated as
`http://my.dev.host/blog-skelton/output_dev/about` instead of `/about`.

## Environments

Sculpin knows the `dev` and `prod` environment. They allow you to have
[different configuration settings by environment]({{site.url}}/documentation/sources/).

Sculpin assumes that all commands will be run in the `dev` environment
unless otherwise specified.

When you want to build the final web site, run the command with the
`--env=prod` option.

```
vendor/bin/sculpin generate --env=prod
```

The output of this command will be placed in `output_prod`. Upload the
contents of this folder to your public website to deploy your site.
