  <h1>Why Sculpin?</h1>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>PHP based static site generator.</strong> Fast and easy to get started. If your language of choice is PHP, you'll feel right at home if you need to extend sculpin.
      <li><strong>Embedded Composer.</strong> Forget about managing library versions manually! <a href="http://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">Composer</a> will keep your source control focused and projects consistent.
      <li><strong>Twig templates.</strong> <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/" target="_blank">Twig</a> is a full-featured modern template engine. It's simple to learn, extendable, documented, concise and flexible.
      <li><strong>Symfony's HTTP Kernel</strong> is a key part of Sculpin. This lets you use Symfony Bundles to extend sculpin for any advanced functionality you need without extending sculpin directly.
