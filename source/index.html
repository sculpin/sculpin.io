  <p>
    <strong>Embedded Composer.</strong> Forget about managing library versions manually! Sculpin embeds <a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> to keep your source control focused and projects consistent.

  <p>
    <strong>Twig templates.</strong> <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a> is a full-featured modern template engine. It's simple to learn and it is extensible, documented, concise and flexible.
