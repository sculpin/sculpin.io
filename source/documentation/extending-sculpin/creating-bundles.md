To start creating bundles to extend Sculpin, check the Symfony 2 section on
[Bundles][1], especially the
[How to use Best Practices for Structuring Bundles][2] documentation. There
really is not much more to extending Sculpin that writing Symfony 2 bundles
that hook into [Sculpin's event lifecycle][3].
