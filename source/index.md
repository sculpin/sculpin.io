## What is Sculpin?

Sculpin is a PHP static site generator built around some incredible tools
including [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) (various components),
[Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) (default formatter),
and [Composer](http://packagist.org) (bundle management).

## Project Status

Sculpin continues to be **unstable**, under heavy development and lacking
documentation. Be prepared for possible changes in core functionality requiring
you to fix your existing site.

But the Sculpin [community]({{site.url}}/community) can help!

The site you are reading is generated using Sculpin.
[View the source on GitHub!](https://github.com/sculpin/getsculpin.com) You are
encouraged to use it as an example of the most up to date feature implementations.

Start by reading the [documentation]({{site.url}}/documentation) to see how this site is
generated.
